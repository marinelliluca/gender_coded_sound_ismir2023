## Summary

Data Processing: 
- Soundtracks trimmed (last 5 seconds removed), 
- features averaged across the trimmed soundtracks

Embeddings: 
- MFCCs (using librosa, 20 bands, delta and delta deltas)
- [MSD model](https://github.com/marinelliluca/transformer-based-music-auto-tagging) (256 dimensions)
- OpenL3 embeddings (512 dimensions).

Training and evaluation: 
- Model checkpoint
- early stopping (patience: 30 epochs, max: 200)
- 5x 5-fold cross-validation (no random seed)
- AdamW optimizer

Multi-task Learning: 
- aesthetic emotions
- music perceptual features
- 4 voice-related classification tasks
- main classification of the commercials in gender targets.
